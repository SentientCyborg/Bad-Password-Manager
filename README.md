# Simple-Password-Manager

This password manager was built as part of an exercise from a Udemy course on Python. The primary purpose was to learn Tkinter. Formatting was done on a Windows 10 machine and may look diffent if run on another OS. The pyperclip submodule is used to automatically copy generated passwords to the clipboard.

**I do not recommend using this to manage passwords. This program stores unencrypted passwords in json file. Anyone with access to the json file can view the saved passwords. This is not secure.**
