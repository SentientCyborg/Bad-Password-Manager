# Simple-Password-Manager

This password manager was built as part of an exercise from a Udemy course on Python. The primary purpose was to learn Tkinter.

**I do not recommend using this to manage passwords. This program stores passwords in a plain text file that is generated when the first password is saved. Anyone with access to the text file can view the saved passwords. This is not secure.**
